# Brick Connect
## **Site Overview**

Brick Connect, which has been crafted using React.js for its frontend development, stands as a vibrant hub within the LEGO enthusiast community, offering a bunch of interactive features tailored towards engagement and creativity. Users can create and share posts showcasing their LEGO creations, insights, and inspirations. This platform gives members the ability to engage with the community by favoriting posts for future reference and expressing appreciation through likes. Brick Connect also gives users the ability to have discussions through commenting on posts, allowing users to share feedback, ask questions, and engage in constructive conversation. Likability extends beyond posts themselves, as users can also express their approval by liking comments. Post owners are able to refine their content through editing or remove it altogether, ensuring they have full control over their contributions. 
Brick Connect is like a digital meeting place for LEGO fans. It's where builders come together to share ideas, learn new things, and enjoy their shared love for LEGO.

Brick Connect serves as a front-end component which is connected to the [Brick Connect API backend](https://github.com/Antonyeaster/brick-connect-api), developed using Django Rest Framework.
